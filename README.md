# Tailwind CSS not picking up styles from JSX files in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with Next.js: Tailwind not picking up styles from JSX files.  The problem lies in the `content` option within the Tailwind configuration file. The provided solution illustrates how to correctly specify the file paths to ensure that your JSX files are processed by Tailwind.

## Bug Report

The initial `tailwind.config.js` file includes an incomplete `content` array, leading to Tailwind CSS ignoring styles within JSX files.  This is a frequent mistake for developers new to Next.js and Tailwind CSS integration.

## Solution

The solution involves correcting the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` to include the correct path to your JSX files.  The updated configuration ensures that Tailwind processes all relevant files correctly.
